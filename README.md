# LiquidCrystal Library for Raspberry Pi Pico
This is a port of the [LiquidCrystal](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal) originally made for Arduino so that it works with the Raspberry Pi Pico. The library probably works with all boards using the RP2040, but I haven't tested it.

This library allows an Raspberry Pi Pico board to control liquid crystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs.

For more information about this library, please refer to the Arduino documentation at: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal
